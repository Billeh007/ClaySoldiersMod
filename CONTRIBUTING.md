If you have any issues with or suggestions for this mod, please read this carefully first and follow the rules.

*Anything that doesn't follow them (and is not fixed after a warning) will get closed.*

### 1. Suggestions
If you have any suggestions, please read the first post of the ["Suggestions" issue](https://github.com/SanAndreasP/ClaySoldiersMod/issues/205)!
It contains all the approved, rejected and already done suggestions.

If you have a new suggestion that is not mentioned there, either open up a new issue (rules for those are mentioned below)
or comment your suggestion(s) below the ["Suggestions" issue](https://github.com/SanAndreasP/ClaySoldiersMod/issues/205).

### 2. Issues
These are the rules if you want/need to submit an issue:
* **One submission for one issue**. If you have multiple issues, please make each issue a separate submission. This way
everything can be kept organized and we can reference it easier in commits.
* **Use the predetermined form**. On creating a new issue, you'll find the issue text contains a form. Please fill out the form accordingly. *If you don't
complete the information and keep it incomplete even after a warning, we reserve the right to close the issue after 14 days
due to missing information*
* **Provide your logs, always.** Your log can be found in either in ```/logs/fml-client-latest.log``` or ```/logs/latest.log```.
Even if you think your logs won't contain useful information, most of the time the log gives us hints as to what your issue
may be caused by.
  * *Do not dump your log file into the submission text!!!* Please copy the log text and paste it to a text sharing site like
[Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/). After you submitted the log, copy the URL of the page
and paste it into the submission text, where the form tells you to put it.
  * *Refrain from uploading the log file to a file uploader in any form!* Files may contain malware and we'd need to download them
first before reading them.
* **Make sure you use the latest of everything.** Your issue may have already been fixed by a new version.
  * Use the latest version of Minecraft the mod is available for. Anything older than that is not supported anymore.
  * Use the latest version of Java that is compatible with Modded Minecraft (in this case Java 8).
* **Please include a (link to a) screenshot or video if it happens to be a visual issue.** Textual descriptions of a visual bug
rarely helps us to identify the actual issue (it gets even worse with very subtle or obscure bugs)
  * As with logs, please upload them to a dedicated image uploader (like [imgur](https://imgur.com/)) or video host
(like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)).

### 3. Pull Requests
* Pull requests are only accepted if it fixes an issue or implements an accepted suggestion / planned feature.
* Please follow the code style of the main code. Simple formatting differences can be fixed by us, but you're encouraged to format
the code appropriately yourself.
* No pull requests for outdated versions of the mod. The only exception given is on gamebreaking issues.
